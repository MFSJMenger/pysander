pysander
========

Welcome to the GitHub repository for pysander, the Python bindings to the sander
API.

This repository is currently a mirror for the version in the official Amber git
repositories (with the full history), and is simply here to provide a place for
conda builds to download the source code from. Eventually we hope that this repo
will be used more extensively, but for now PRs to this repository will be
ignored.

Install
=======

Regular users should always install official version from http://ambermd.org/

Experienced users can try the conda version
```bash
conda install pysander -c ambermd
```
